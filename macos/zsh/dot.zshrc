# To make Homebrew's completion available in zsh, you must get the
# Homebrew-managed zsh site-functions on you FPATH before initialising
# zsh's completion facility.
# The following code block needs to be evaluated before
# `compinit`. If you are using oh-my-zsh.sh, then compinit
# will be called. That means the following code block
# needs to be evaluated before calling oh-my-zsh.sh
# After that, force rebuild `zcompdump`, as follows:
# rm -f ~/.zcompdump; compinit
# Additionally, if you receive `zsh compinit: insecure directories`
# warnings when attempting to load these completions Â´, you may need
# to run this:
# chmod go-w "$(brew --prefix)/share"
if type brew &>/dev/null; then
  FPATH=$(brew --prefix)/share/zsh/site-functions:$FPATH
