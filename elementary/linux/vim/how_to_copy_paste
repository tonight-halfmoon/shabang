Here is how to cut-and-paste or copy-and-paste text using a visual selection in Vim. See Cut/copy and paste using visual selection for the main article.

Cut and paste:

    Position the cursor where you want to begin cutting.
    Press v to select characters (or uppercase V to select whole lines, or Ctrl-v to select rectangular blocks).
    Move the cursor to the end of what you want to cut.
    Press d to cut (or y to copy).
    Move to where you would like to paste.
    Press P to paste before the cursor, or p to paste after. 

Copy and paste is performed with the same steps except for step 4 where you would press y instead of d:

    d stands for delete in Vim, which in other editors is usually called cut
    y stands for yank in Vim, which in other editors is usually called copy
